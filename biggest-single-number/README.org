Table number contains many numbers in column num including duplicated ones.
Can you write a SQL query to find the biggest number, which only appears once.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
+---+
|num|
+---+
| 8 |
| 8 |
| 3 |
| 3 |
| 1 |
| 4 |
| 5 |
| 6 | 
#+END_EXAMPLE

For the sample data above, your query should return the following result:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
+---+
|num|
+---+
| 6 |
#+END_EXAMPLE

Note:
If there is no such number, just output null.
