There is a table courses with columns: student and class  

Please list out all classes which have more than or equal to 5 students.  

For example, the table:  

    +---------+------------+
    | student | class      |
    +---------+------------+
    | A       | Math       |
    | B       | English    |
    | C       | Math       |
    | D       | Biology    |
    | E       | Math       |
    | F       | Computer   |
    | G       | Math       |
    | H       | Math       |
    | I       | Math       |
    +---------+------------+

Should output:  

    +---------+
    | class   |
    +---------+
    | Math    |
    +---------+

Note:  
The students should not be counted duplicate in each course.
