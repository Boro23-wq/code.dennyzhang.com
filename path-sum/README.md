# Leetcode: Path Sum     :BLOG:Basic:

Path Sum  

---

Given a binary tree and a sum, determine if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the path equals the given sum.  

    For example:
    Given the below binary tree and sum = 22,
                  5
                 / \
                4   8
               /   / \
              11  13  4
             /  \      \
            7    2      1
    return true, as there exist a root-to-leaf path 5->4->11->2 which sum is 22.
