Give an array and a target. We need to find the number of subsets which meet the following conditions:  
The sum of the minimum value and the maximum value in the subset is less than the target.  

Notice  
-   The length of the given array does not exceed 50.
-   target <= 100000.

Example  
Give array = [1,5,2,4,3], target = 4, return 2.  

    Explanation:
    Only subset [1],[1,2] satisfy the condition, so the answer is 2.
    Give array = [1,5,2,4,3],target = 5, return 5.

    Explanation:
    Only subset [1],[2],[1,3],[1,2],[1,2,3] satisfy the condition, so the answer is 5.
