Given an array of integers nums and a positive integer k, find whether it's possible to divide this array into k non-empty subsets whose sums are all equal.  

    Example 1:
    Input: nums = [4, 3, 2, 3, 5, 2, 1], k = 4
    Output: True
    Explanation: It's possible to divide it into 4 subsets (5), (1, 4), (2,3), (2,3) with equal sums.

Note:  

-   1 <= k <= len(nums) <= 16.
-   0 < nums[i] < 10000.
