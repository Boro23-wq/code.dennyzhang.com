Given n, find the number of solutions for all x, y, z that conforms to x^2+y^2+z^2 = n.(x, y, z are non-negative integers)  

 Notice  
n <= 1000000  
x, y, z satisfy (x <= y <= z), we can consider that is the same solution as long as the three numbers selected are the same  
Have you met this question in a real interview?  

Example  

    Given n = 0, return 1.
    
    Explanation:
    When x = 0, y = 0, z = 0, the equation holds.

    Given n = 1, return 1.
    
    Explanation:
    When one of them is 1 and the remaining two are 0, there is a total of 1 solution.
