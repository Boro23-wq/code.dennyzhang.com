Palindrome Partitioning  

---

Given a string s, partition s such that every substring of the partition is a palindrome.  

Return the minimum cuts needed for a palindrome partitioning of s.  

For example, given s = "aab",  
Return 1 since the palindrome partitioning ["aa","b"] could be produced using 1 cut.
