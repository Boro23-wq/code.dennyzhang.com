The set [1,2,3,&#x2026;,n] contains a total of n! unique permutations.  

By listing and labeling all of the permutations in order, we get the following sequence for n = 3:  

1.  "123"
2.  "132"
3.  "213"
4.  "231"
5.  "312"
6.  "321"

Given n and k, return the kth permutation sequence.  

Note:  

-   Given n will be between 1 and 9 inclusive.
-   Given k will be between 1 and n! inclusive.

Example 1:  

    Input: n = 3, k = 3
    Output: "213"

Example 2:  

    Input: n = 4, k = 9
    Output: "2314"
