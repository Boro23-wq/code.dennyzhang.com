# Leetcode: Single Number     :BLOG:Easy:


---

Identity number which appears exactly once.  

---

Given an array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.  

Note:  
Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

        s = Solution()
        print s.singleNumber([1, 2, 1])
        print s.singleNumber([2, 2, 1])
