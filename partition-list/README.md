Partition List  

---

Given a linked list and a value x, partition it such that all nodes less than x come before nodes greater than or equal to x.  

You should preserve the original relative order of the nodes in each of the two partitions.  

For example,  
Given 1->4->3->2->5->2 and x = 3,  
return 1->2->2->4->3->5.

    ## Basic Ideas: 3 pointer. 
    ##     p_last_less: last node which is less than x
    ##     p_last_greater: last node which is greater than x
    ##     p: trasverse the list
    ## Complexity: Time O(n), Space O(1)
