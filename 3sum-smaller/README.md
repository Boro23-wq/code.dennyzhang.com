Given an array of n integers nums and a target, find the number of index triplets i, j, k with 0 <= i < j < k < n that satisfy the condition nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] < target.  

For example, given nums = [-2, 0, 1, 3], and target = 2.  

Return 2. Because there are two triplets which sums are less than 2:  

    [-2, 0, 1]
    [-2, 0, 3]
