Given an array of integers with possible duplicates, randomly output the index of a given target number. You can assume that the given target number must exist in the array.  

Note:  
The array size can be very large. Solution that uses too much extra space will not pass the judge.  

Example:  

    int[] nums = new int[] {1,2,3,3,3};
    Solution solution = new Solution(nums);
    
    // pick(3) should return either index 2, 3, or 4 randomly. Each index should have equal probability of returning.
    solution.pick(3);
    
    // pick(1) should return 0. Since in the array only nums[0] is equal to 1.
    solution.pick(1);
