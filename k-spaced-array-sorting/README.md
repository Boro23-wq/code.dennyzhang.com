K Spaced Array Sorting  

---

An array is ordered from small to large every k digits, ie arr[i] <= arr[i + k] <= arr[i + 2 \* k] <= &#x2026;. Sort the array from small to large. We expect you to write an algorithm whose time complexity is O(n \* logk).  

Notice  
-   0 <= arr[i] <= 2^31 - 1
-   1 <= |arr| <= 10^5
-   1 <= k <= 10^5

Example  

    Given arr = [1,2,3], k = 1, return [1,2,3].
    
    Explanation:
    The sorted array is [1,2,3].

Given arr = [4,0,5,3,10], k = 2, return [0,3,4,5,10].  

    Explanation:
    The sorted array is [0,3,4,5,10].
