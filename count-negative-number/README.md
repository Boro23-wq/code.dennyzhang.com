Give a horizontally sorted and vertically sorted n \* m matrix, find the number of negative number.  

 Notice  
The size of given matrix is n x m, n <= 500, m <= 500.  
In order to restrain the time complexity of the program, your program will run 10 ^ 5 times.  
Have you met this question in a real interview?  
Example  

    Given mat =
    
    [
        [-5,-3,-1,0,1],
        [-2,-1,0,0,1],
        [0,11,12,12,14]
    ],
    return 5.

    Explanation:
    There are only 5 negative number.
    Given mat =
    
    [
        [-50,-30,-10,-5],
        [-30,-20,-5,-1],
        [-10,-5,-1,0]
    ]
    return 11ã€‚
    
    Explanation:
    There are only 11 negative number.
