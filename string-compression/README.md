String Compression  

---

Given an array of characters, compress it in-place.  

The length after compression must always be smaller than or equal to the original array.  

Every element of the array should be a character (not int) of length 1.  

After you are done modifying the input array in-place, return the new length of the array.  

Follow up:  
Could you solve it using only O(1) extra space?  

    Example 1:
    Input:
    ["a","a","b","b","c","c","c"]
    
    Output:
    Return 6, and the first 6 characters of the input array should be: ["a","2","b","2","c","3"]
    
    Explanation:
    "aa" is replaced by "a2". "bb" is replaced by "b2". "ccc" is replaced by "c3".

    Example 2:
    Input:
    ["a"]
    
    Output:
    Return 1, and the first 1 characters of the input array should be: ["a"]
    
    Explanation:
    Nothing is replaced.

    Example 3:
    Input:
    ["a","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b"]
    
    Output:
    Return 4, and the first 4 characters of the input array should be: ["a","b","1","2"].
    
    Explanation:
    Since the character "a" does not repeat, it is not compressed. "bbbbbbbbbbbb" is replaced by "b12".

Notice each digit has it's own entry in the array.  
Note:  
All characters have an ASCII value in [35, 126].  
1 <= len(chars) <= 1000.
