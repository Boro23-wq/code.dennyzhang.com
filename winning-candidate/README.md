    select Name
    from Candidate where
    id = (select CandidateId
         from Vote
         group by CandidateId
         order by count(1) desc
         limit 1)
    
    ## Assumtion: if we have two candidates with the same votes, we choose the one who get the first vote
    # select Name
    # from Candidate inner join
    #     (select CandidateId
    #     from Vote
    #     group by CandidateId
    #     order by count(1) desc
    #     limit 1) as t
    # on Candidate.id = t.CandidateId
