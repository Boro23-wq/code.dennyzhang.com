Given a string, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of characters.  

Example 1:  

    Input:
    "tree"
    
    Output:
    "eert"
    
    Explanation:
    'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once.
    So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore "eetr" is also a valid answer.

Example 2:  

    Input:
    "cccaaa"
    
    Output:
    "cccaaa"
    
    Explanation:
    Both 'c' and 'a' appear three times, so "aaaccc" is also a valid answer.
    Note that "cacaca" is incorrect, as the same characters must be together.

Example 3:  

    Input:
    "Aabb"
    
    Output:
    "bbAa"
    
    Explanation:
    "bbaA" is also a valid answer, but "Aabb" is incorrect.
    Note that 'A' and 'a' are treated as two different characters.
