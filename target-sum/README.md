You are given a list of non-negative integers, a1, a2, &#x2026;, an, and a target, S. Now you have 2 symbols + and -. For each integer, you should choose one from + and - as its new symbol.  

Find out how many ways to assign symbols to make sum of integers equal to target S.  

Example 1:  

    Input: nums is [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], S is 3. 
    Output: 5
    Explanation: 
    
    -1+1+1+1+1 = 3
    +1-1+1+1+1 = 3
    +1+1-1+1+1 = 3
    +1+1+1-1+1 = 3
    +1+1+1+1-1 = 3
    
    There are 5 ways to assign symbols to make the sum of nums be target 3.

Note:  
-   The length of the given array is positive and will not exceed 20.
-   The sum of elements in the given array will not exceed 1000.
-   Your output answer is guaranteed to be fitted in a 32-bit integer.

Leave me comments, if you have better ways to solve.  

    // Blog link: https://code.dennyzhang.com/target-sum
    // Basic Ideas: BFS + hashmap
    // Complexity: Time O(pow(2, n)), Space O(1)
    //   The value would be in between -1000 and 1000
    //   Thus Space is O(1)
