We are given an array A of positive integers, and two positive integers L and R (L <= R).  

Return the number of (contiguous, non-empty) subarrays such that the value of the maximum array element in that subarray is at least L and at most R.  

Example :  

    Input: 
    A = [2, 1, 4, 3]
    L = 2
    R = 3
    Output: 3
    Explanation: There are three subarrays that meet the requirements: [2], [2, 1], [3].

Note:  

-   L, R  and A[i] will be an integer in the range [0, 10^9].
-   The length of A will be in the range of [1, 50000].

    ## Basic Ideas:
    ##
    ##  Separate by values which is greater than R
    ##
    ## Complexity: Time O(n*n), Space O(1)
