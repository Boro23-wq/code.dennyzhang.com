# Leetcode: Valid Palindrome     :BLOG:Basic:


---

Given a string, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases.  

---

Given a string, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases.  

For example,  
"A man, a plan, a canal: Panama" is a palindrome.  
"race a car" is not a palindrome.  

Note:  
Have you consider that the string might be empty? This is a good question to ask during an interview.  

For the purpose of this problem, we define empty string as valid palindrome.
