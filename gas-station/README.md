There are N gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at station i is gas[i].  

You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs cost[i] of gas to travel from station i to its next station (i+1). You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.  

Return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once, otherwise return -1.  

Note:  
The solution is guaranteed to be unique.

Leave me comments, if you have better ways to solve.  

    ## Blog link: https://code.dennyzhang.com/gas-station
    ## Basic Ideas: One pass
    ##    If gas[i] - cost[i] < 0, this node can't be the target
    ##
    ##    If total sum of gas-cost < 0, we can't find the solution.
    ##    If total sum of gas-cost >=0, we must be able to find one solution
    ##
    ##    Get accumulated sum of gas-cost
    ##       If it turn to negative, this node and all previous nodes can't be the target

    ##    Question: 
    ##       How to handle a circle, instead of an array?
    ##       How to detect cases with no solution?

    ## Complexity: Time O(n), Space O(1)
