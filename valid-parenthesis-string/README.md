Given a string containing only three types of characters: '(', ')' and '\*', write a function to check whether this string is valid. We define the validity of a string by these rules:  

Any left parenthesis '(' must have a corresponding right parenthesis ')'.  
Any right parenthesis ')' must have a corresponding left parenthesis '('.  
Left parenthesis '(' must go before the corresponding right parenthesis ')'.  
'\*' could be treated as a single right parenthesis ')' or a single left parenthesis '(' or an empty string.  
An empty string is also valid.  

Example 1:  

    Input: "()"
    Output: True

Example 2:  

    Input: "(*)"
    Output: True

Example 3:  

    Input: "(*))"
    Output: True

Note:  
-   The string size will be in the range [1, 100].
