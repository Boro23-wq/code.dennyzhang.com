Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: "The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes v and w as the lowest node in T that has both v and w as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself)."

Given the following binary search tree:  root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4]
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
        _______3______
       /              \
    ___5__          ___1__
   /      \        /      \
   6      _2       0       8
         /  \
         7   4
#+END_EXAMPLE

Example 1:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Input: root, p = 5, q = 1
Output: 3
Explanation: The LCA of of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.
#+END_EXAMPLE

Example 2:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Input: root, p = 5, q = 4
Output: 5
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant of itself
             according to the LCA definition.
