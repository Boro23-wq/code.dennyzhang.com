Average of Levels in Binary Tree  

---

Given a non-empty binary tree, return the average value of the nodes on each level in the form of an array.  

    Example 1:
    Input:
        3
       / \
      9  20
        /  \
       15   7
    Output: [3, 14.5, 11]

Explanation:  
The average value of nodes on level 0 is 3,  on level 1 is 14.5, and on level 2 is 11. Hence return [3, 14.5, 11].  
Note:  
The range of node's value is in the range of 32-bit signed integer.
