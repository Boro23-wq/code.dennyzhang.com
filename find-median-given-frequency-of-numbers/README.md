The Numbers table keeps the value of number and its frequency.  

    +----------+-------------+
    |  Number  |  Frequency  |
    +----------+-------------|
    |  0       |  7          |
    |  1       |  1          |
    |  2       |  3          |
    |  3       |  1          |
    +----------+-------------+

In this table, the numbers are 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, so the median is (0 + 0) / 2 = 0.  

    +--------+
    | median |
    +--------|
    | 0.0000 |
    +--------+

Write a query to find the median of all numbers and name the result as median.
