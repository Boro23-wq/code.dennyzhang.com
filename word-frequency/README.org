Write a bash script to calculate the frequency of each word in a text file words.txt.

For simplicity sake, you may assume:

- words.txt contains only lowercase characters and space ' ' characters.
- Each word must consist of lowercase characters only.
- Words are separated by one or more whitespace characters.

For example, assume that *words.txt* has the following content:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
the day is sunny the the
the sunny is is
#+END_EXAMPLE

Your script should output the following, sorted by descending frequency:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
the 4
is 3
sunny 2
day 1
#+END_EXAMPLE

Note:
Don't worry about handling ties, it is guaranteed that each word's frequency count is unique.
