Find the Difference  

---

Given two strings s and t which consist of only lowercase letters.  

String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.  

Find the letter that was added in t.  

Example:  

    Input:
    s = "abcd"
    t = "abcde"
    
    Output:
    e
