You are given an integer array sorted in ascending order (may contain duplicates), you need to split them into several subsequences, where each subsequences consist of at least 3 consecutive integers. Return whether you can make such a split.

Example 1:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Input: [1,2,3,3,4,5]
Output: True
Explanation:
You can split them into two consecutive subsequences : 
1, 2, 3
3, 4, 5
#+END_EXAMPLE

Example 2:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Input: [1,2,3,3,4,4,5,5]
Output: True
Explanation:
You can split them into two consecutive subsequences : 
1, 2, 3, 4, 5
3, 4, 5
#+END_EXAMPLE

Example 3:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Input: [1,2,3,4,4,5]
Output: False
#+END_EXAMPLE

Note:
- The length of the input is in range of [1, 10000]
