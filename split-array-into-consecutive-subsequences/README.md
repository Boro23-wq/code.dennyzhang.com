You are given an integer array sorted in ascending order (may contain duplicates), you need to split them into several subsequences, where each subsequences consist of at least 3 consecutive integers. Return whether you can make such a split.  

Example 1:  

    Input: [1,2,3,3,4,5]
    Output: True
    Explanation:
    You can split them into two consecutive subsequences : 
    1, 2, 3
    3, 4, 5

Example 2:  

    Input: [1,2,3,3,4,4,5,5]
    Output: True
    Explanation:
    You can split them into two consecutive subsequences : 
    1, 2, 3, 4, 5
    3, 4, 5

Example 3:  

    Input: [1,2,3,4,4,5]
    Output: False

Note:  
-   The length of the input is in range of [1, 10000]
