Count Complete Tree Nodes  

---

Given a complete binary tree, count the number of nodes.  

Definition of a complete binary tree from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree#Types_of_binary_trees):  
In a complete binary tree every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.

    ## Blog link: http://brain.dennyzhang.com/count-complete-tree-nodes
    ## Basic Ideas: Cut the examine dataset into half
    ##              Check height of sub-tree and right-tree
    ##              For each divide-conquer, one half will be solved without recursive
    ##
    ##    Sample Data: 
    ##             1        
    ##           /   \
    ##          2     3
    ##         /
    ##        4
    ##
    ## Complexity: Time O(h*log(n)) = O(log(n)*log(n)). Space O(1). If include system stack, Space O(log(n))
