Get the highest answer rate question from a table survey\_log with these columns: uid, action, question\_id, answer\_id, q\_num, timestamp.  

uid means user id; action has these kind of values: "show", "answer", "skip"; answer\_id is not null when action column is "answer", while is null for "show" and "skip"; q\_num is the numeral order of the question in current session.  

Write a sql query to identify the question which has the highest answer rate.  

Example:  
Input:  

    +------+-----------+--------------+------------+-----------+------------+
    | uid  | action    | question_id  | answer_id  | q_num     | timestamp  |
    +------+-----------+--------------+------------+-----------+------------+
    | 5    | show      | 285          | null       | 1         | 123        |
    | 5    | answer    | 285          | 124124     | 1         | 124        |
    | 5    | show      | 369          | null       | 2         | 125        |
    | 5    | skip      | 369          | null       | 2         | 126        |
    +------+-----------+--------------+------------+-----------+------------+

Output:  

    +-------------+
    | survey_log  |
    +-------------+
    |    285      |
    +-------------+

Explanation:  
question 285 has answer rate 1/1, while question 369 has 0/1 answer rate, so output 285.  

Note: The highest answer rate meaning is: answer number's ratio in show number in the same question.
