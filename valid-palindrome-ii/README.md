Valid Palindrome II  

---

Given a non-empty string s, you may delete at most one character. Judge whether you can make it a palindrome.  

    Example 1:
    Input: "aba"
    Output: True

    Example 2:
    Input: "abca"
    Output: True
    Explanation: You could delete the character 'c'.

Note:  
The string will only contain lowercase characters a-z. The maximum length of the string is 50000.
