You are playing the following Flip Game with your friend: Given a string that contains only these two characters: + and -, you and your friend take turns to flip two consecutive "++" into "&#x2013;". The game ends when a person can no longer make a move and therefore the other person will be the winner.  

Write a function to compute all possible states of the string after one valid move.  

For example, given s = "<del>++</del>", after one move, it may become one of the following states:  

    [
      "--++",
      "+--+",
      "++--"
    ]

If there is no valid move, return an empty list [].
