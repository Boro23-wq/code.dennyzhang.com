You are standing at position 0 on an infinite number line. There is a goal at position target.  

On each move, you can either go left or right. During the n-th move (starting from 1), you take n steps.  

Return the minimum number of steps required to reach the destination.  

Example 1:  

    Input: target = 3
    Output: 2
    Explanation:
    On the first move we step from 0 to 1.
    On the second step we step from 1 to 3.

Example 2:  

    Input: target = 2
    Output: 3
    Explanation:
    On the first move we step from 0 to 1.
    On the second move we step  from 1 to -1.
    On the third move we step from -1 to 2.

Note:  

-   target will be a non-zero integer in the range [-10^9, 10^9].

    ## Blog link: https://code.dennyzhang.com/reach-a-number
    ## Basic Ideas: BFS
    ##      1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 - 6 ... : get -n
    ##      -1 + 2 - 3 + 4 - 5 + 6 ... : get n
    ##
    ##      So the minimum step will be no more than 2n.
    ##      If abs(value) is bigger than 2*n, we don't need to examine it.
    ##
    ## Complexity: Time O(n), Space O(n)
    class Solution:
        def reachNumber(self, target):
    	"""
    	:type target: int
    	:rtype: int
    	"""
    	if target == 0: return 0
    	import collections
    	queue = collections.deque()
    	step = 0
    	queue.append(0)
    	while len(queue) != 0 and step<=abs(2*target):
