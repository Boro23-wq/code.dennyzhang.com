You are standing at position 0 on an infinite number line. There is a goal at position target.

On each move, you can either go left or right. During the n-th move (starting from 1), you take n steps.

Return the minimum number of steps required to reach the destination.

Example 1:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Input: target = 3
Output: 2
Explanation:
On the first move we step from 0 to 1.
On the second step we step from 1 to 3.
#+END_EXAMPLE

Example 2:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Input: target = 2
Output: 3
Explanation:
On the first move we step from 0 to 1.
On the second move we step  from 1 to -1.
On the third move we step from -1 to 2.
#+END_EXAMPLE

Note:
- target will be a non-zero integer in the range [-10^9, 10^9].
