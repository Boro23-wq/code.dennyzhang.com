Given an array of n positive integers and a positive integer s, find the minimal length of a contiguous subarray of which the sum >= s. If there isn't one, return 0 instead.  

For example, given the array [2,3,1,2,4,3] and s = 7,  
the subarray [4,3] has the minimal length under the problem constraint.  

More practice:  
If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution of which the time complexity is O(n log n).

    ## Basic Ideas: Two pointers + Ge accumulated sum
    ##
    ##   Corner case: 0 elements or 1 elements
    ##   Right pointer move one step each time.
    ##   Left pointer don't need to move left. Why? We only need to find the minimal length
    ##
    ## Complexity: Time O(n), Space O(1)
