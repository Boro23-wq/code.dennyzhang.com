# Leetcode: Lexicographical Numbers     :BLOG:Medium:


---

Given an integer n, return 1 - n in lexicographical order.  

---

Given an integer n, return 1 - n in lexicographical order.  

For example, given 13, return: [1,10,11,12,13,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9].  

Please optimize your algorithm to use less time and space. The input size may be as large as 5,000,000.

    ##  When to push? How to find the neighbors?

    ## Complexity: Time O(k), Space O(d)
    ##             k = size of final result
    ##             d = digits of n
