A gene string can be represented by an 8-character long string, with choices from "A", "C", "G", "T".

Suppose we need to investigate about a mutation (mutation from "start" to "end"), where ONE mutation is defined as ONE single character changed in the gene string.

For example, "AACCGGTT" -> "AACCGGTA" is 1 mutation.

Also, there is a given gene "bank", which records all the valid gene mutations. A gene must be in the bank to make it a valid gene string.

Now, given 3 things - start, end, bank, your task is to determine what is the minimum number of mutations needed to mutate from "start" to "end". If there is no such a mutation, return -1.

Note:

1. Starting point is assumed to be valid, so it might not be included in the bank.
- If multiple mutations are needed, all mutations during in the sequence must be valid.
- You may assume start and end string is not the same.

Example 1:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
start: "AACCGGTT"
end:   "AACCGGTA"
bank: ["AACCGGTA"]

return: 1
#+END_EXAMPLE

Example 2:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
start: "AACCGGTT"
end:   "AAACGGTA"
bank: ["AACCGGTA", "AACCGCTA", "AAACGGTA"]

return: 2
#+END_EXAMPLE

Example 3:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
start: "AAAAACCC"
end:   "AACCCCCC"
bank: ["AAAACCCC", "AAACCCCC", "AACCCCCC"]

return: 3
#+END_EXAMPLE

## Complexity: Time O(1), Space O(1)
##     We will only have 8 characters. pow(4, 8) is still O(1)
