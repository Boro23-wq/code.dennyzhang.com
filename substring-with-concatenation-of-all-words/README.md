Substring with Concatenation of All Words  

---

You are given a string, s, and a list of words, words, that are all of the same length. Find all starting indices of substring(s) in s that is a concatenation of each word in words exactly once and without any intervening characters.  

    For example, given:
    s: "barfoothefoobarman"
    words: ["foo", "bar"]
    
    You should return the indices: [0,9].
    (order does not matter).
