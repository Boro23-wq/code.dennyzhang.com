Suppose you have a random list of people standing in a queue. Each person is described by a pair of integers (h, k), where h is the height of the person and k is the number of people in front of this person who have a height greater than or equal to h. Write an algorithm to reconstruct the queue.  

Note: The number of people is less than 1,100.  

Example  

    Input:
    [[7,0], [4,4], [7,1], [5,0], [6,1], [5,2]]
    
    Output:
    [[5,0], [7,0], [5,2], [6,1], [4,4], [7,1]]

    // Blog link: https://code.dennyzhang.com/queue-reconstruction-by-height
    // Basic Ideas:
    //     Intuitive Idea: Find the mininum h, whose k is 0
    //        Once we have identified one, 
    //          we deduct k of other other items whose h is no smaller than current one
    //
    //     Better Idea: sort and insert
    //
    // [[7,0], [4,4], [7,1], [5,0], [6,1], [5,2]]
    //
    // sorted:
    // [[7,0], [7,1], [6,1], [5,0], [5,2], [4,4]]
    //
    // switch:
    // [[7,0], [6,1], [7,1], [5,0], [5,2], [4,4]]
    // [[5,0], [7,0], [6,1], [7,1], [5,2], [4,4]]
    // [[5,0], [7,0], [5,2], [6,1], [7,1], [4,4]]
    // [[5,0], [7,0], [5,2], [6,1], [4,4], [7,1]]
    //
    // TODO: need a simple way to switch items
    //
    // Complexity: Time O(n*n), Space O(n)
