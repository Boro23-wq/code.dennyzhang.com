Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum  

---

Given a binary tree, find the maximum path sum.  

For this problem, a path is defined as any sequence of nodes from some starting node to any node in the tree along the parent-child connections. The path must contain at least one node and does not need to go through the root.  

    For example:
    Given the below binary tree,
    
           1
          / \
         2   3
    Return 6.
