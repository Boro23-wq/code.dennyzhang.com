Count Binary Substrings  

---

Give a string s, count the number of non-empty (contiguous) substrings that have the same number of 0's and 1's, and all the 0's and all the 1's in these substrings are grouped consecutively.  

Substrings that occur multiple times are counted the number of times they occur.  

    Example 1:
    Input: "00110011"
    Output: 6
    Explanation: There are 6 substrings that have equal number of consecutive 1's and 0's: "0011", "01", "1100", "10", "0011", and "01".
    
    Notice that some of these substrings repeat and are counted the number of times they occur.
    
    Also, "00110011" is not a valid substring because all the 0's (and 1's) are not grouped together.

    Example 2:
    Input: "10101"
    Output: 4
    Explanation: There are 4 substrings: "10", "01", "10", "01" that have equal number of consecutive 1's and 0's.
    Note:
    
    s.length will be between 1 and 50,000.
    s will only consist of "0" or "1" characters.

Leave me comments, if you know how to solve.  

    ## Basic Ideas:
    ##       No more than 2 elements would be qualified.
    ## Complexity: Time O(n), Space O(1)
    ## Sample Data:
    ##    1 2 3 2 3 3
    ## Asummption:
    class Solution(object):
        def majorityElement(self, nums):
            """
            :type nums: List[int]
            :rtype: List[int]
            """
            length = len(nums)
            if length == 0:
                return 
            n1, n2 = None, None
            c1, c2 = 0, 0
            for num in nums:
                if num == n1:
                    c1 += 1
                elif num == n2:
                    c2 += 1
                elif c1 == 0:
                    n1, c1 = num, 1
                elif c2 == 0:
                    n2, c2 = num, 1
                else:
                    c1, c2 = c1 - 1, c2 - 1
            c1, c2 = 0, 0
            for num in nums:
                if num == n1:
                    c1 += 1
                elif num == n2:
                    c2 += 1
            # print("n1: %d, c1: %d, n2: %d, c2: %d. length: %d" % (n1, c1, n2, c2, length))
            res = 
            if c1 > length/3:
                res.append(n1)
            if c2 > length/3:
                res.append(n2)
            return res
    
    s = Solution()
    # print s.majorityElement([1, 2])
    # print s.majorityElement([1,2,1,1,1,3,3,4,3,3,3,4,4,4])
    print s.majorityElement([1,1,1,2,3,4,5,6])
    # print s.majorityElement([1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 3])
