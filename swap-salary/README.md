Given a table salary, such as the one below, that has m=male and f=female values. Swap all f and m values (i.e., change all f values to m and vice versa) with a single update query and no intermediate temp table.  
For example:  

    | id | name | sex | salary |
    |----|------|-----|--------|
    | 1  | A    | m   | 2500   |
    | 2  | B    | f   | 1500   |
    | 3  | C    | m   | 5500   |
    | 4  | D    | f   | 500    |

After running your query, the above salary table should have the following rows:  

    | id | name | sex | salary |
    |----|------|-----|--------|
    | 1  | A    | f   | 2500   |
    | 2  | B    | m   | 1500   |
    | 3  | C    | f   | 5500   |
    | 4  | D    | m   | 500    |
