Given a set of distinct integers, nums, return all possible subsets (the power set).  

Note: The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets.  

For example,  

    If nums = [1,2,3], a solution is:
    
    [
      [3],
      [1],
      [2],
      [1,2,3],
      [1,3],
      [2,3],
      [1,2],
      []
    ]
