Given n non-negative integers representing the histogram's bar height where the width of each bar is 1, find the area of largest rectangle in the histogram.

Above is a histogram where width of each bar is 1, given height = [2,1,5,6,2,3].

The largest rectangle is shown in the shaded area, which has area = 10 unit.  

For example,  
Given heights = [2,1,5,6,2,3],  
return 10.

    ## Basic Ideas: Monotone stack
    ##              For each element, find the next non-greater value
    ##     Key Questions: How to get the left?
    ##                    What if right is not found, any special logic?
