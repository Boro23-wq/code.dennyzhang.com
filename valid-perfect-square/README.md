Valid Perfect Square  

---

Given a positive integer num, write a function which returns True if num is a perfect square else False.  

Note: Do not use any built-in library function such as sqrt.  

    Example 1:
    
    Input: 16
    Returns: True

    Example 2:
    
    Input: 14
    Returns: False

    ## Basic Ideas: Binary search
    ##             Search in between [1^2, 2^2, 3^2, ... num^2]
    ##     But we have to use long for mid to avoid *mid\mid from overflow
    ## Complexity: Time O(log(n)), Space O(1)
