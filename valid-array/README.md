If an array contains only one number that has an odd number of times, the array is valid, otherwise the array is invalid. Enter an array a containing only positive integers to determine if the array is valid. Return the number which has odd number of times if it is valid, return -1 if it is invalid.  

The length of the array does not exceed 10^5â€‹, each number in the array is less than or equal to 10^9.  

Example  

    Given a=[1,1,2,2,3,4,4,5,5], return 3.
    
    Explanation:
    In this array, only 3 has odd number of times, so return 3.

    Given a=[1,1,2,2,3,4,4,5], return -1.
    
    Explanation:
    In this array, 3 and 5 have odd number of times, so it is invalid and return -1.
