Given a non-empty array of integers, return the k most frequent elements.  

For example,  
Given [1,1,1,2,2,3] and k = 2, return [1,2].  

Note:  
You may assume k is always valid, 1 <= k <= number of unique elements.  
Your algorithm's time complexity must be better than O(n log n), where n is the array's size.
