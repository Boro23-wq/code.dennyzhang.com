# Leetcode: Array Partition I     :BLOG:Amusing:


---

Pair elements  

---

Given an array of 2n integers, your task is to group these integers into n pairs of integer, say (a1, b1), (a2, b2), &#x2026;, (an, bn) which makes sum of min(ai, bi) for all i from 1 to n as large as possible.  

    Example 1:
    Input: [1,4,3,2]
    
    Output: 4
    Explanation: n is 2, and the maximum sum of pairs is 4 = min(1, 2) + min(3, 4).

Note:  
-   n is a positive integer, which is in the range of [1, 10000].
-   All the integers in the array will be in the range of [-10000, 10000].
