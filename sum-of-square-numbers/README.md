Sum of Square Numbers  

---

Given a non-negative integer c, your task is to decide whether there're two integers a and b such that a\*a + b\*b = c.  

    Example 1:
    Input: 5
    Output: True
    Explanation: 1 * 1 + 2 * 2 = 5

    Example 2:
    Input: 3
    Output: False

Leave me comments, if you have better ways to solve.  

    ## Blog link: http://brain.dennyzhang.com/sum-of-square-numbers
    ## Basic Ideas: max(a, b) <= int(sqrt(c))
    ##              Then we convert it into a two-sum problem
    ##
    ##  Assumption: a, b can be 0
    ## Complexity: Time O(sqrt(n)), Space O(1)
