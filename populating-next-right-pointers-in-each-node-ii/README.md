Follow up for problem "Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node".  

What if the given tree could be any binary tree? Would your previous solution still work?  

Note:  

You may only use constant extra space.  

    For example,
    Given the following binary tree,
             1
           /  \
          2    3
         / \    \
        4   5    7
    After calling your function, the tree should look like:
             1 -> NULL
           /  \
          2 -> 3 -> NULL
         / \    \
        4-> 5 -> 7 -> NULL
