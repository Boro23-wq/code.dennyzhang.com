##    ,-----------
##    | There are a total of n courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to n - 1.
##    | 
##    | Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]
##    | 
##    | Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, is it possible for you to finish all courses?
##    | 
##    | For example:
##    | 
##    | 2, [[1,0]]
##    | There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
##    | 
##    | 2, [[1,0],[0,1]]
##    | There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
##    | 
##    | Note:
##    | The input prerequisites is a graph represented by a list of edges, not adjacency matrices. Read more about how a graph is represented.
##    | You may assume that there are no duplicate edges in the input prerequisites.
