## Basic Elements:
- Description
- Basic Idea
- Complexity

## Procedure
1. Read and explain the question to the interviewr: Show you understand the questions
2. Interviewer may ask: tell me what you are thinking
3. Show your programming skills: how fluent you are with the language and lib
4. Watch out Complexity trade-off, and you may need to explain them
5. You can run unit test

## Command
- Find amusing tickets
find . -name *.py | xargs grep -C 3 amusing | grep -v Author | grep -v Description | grep -v "\-\-" | grep -v "File:" | grep -v "^$" | grep https

## Binary Search
- binary search: log(n)

## Lesson learned from Cracking leetcode.com
- Learn to write bug-free code. Test-driven may lead you to waste time? If you think clearly and pass with once
- Understand data structure and common library in your languages: Python TreeNode, Python Interval
- Write your idea, before you coding. Update time/space complexity in advance.
- Know how to use library. Thus we can think and design in a higher layer. But make sure you can evaluate the time and space performance
- Think in a natural way, instead of a complicated way
- Time complexity of n is similar to 2n, but it's 100% faster in our real production!
- Don't write in your IDE. emacs/vi
- **Choose the proper variable names: easy to understand**
- **Explain the usage of your key data structure**
- **Read other people's code, then learn something**
