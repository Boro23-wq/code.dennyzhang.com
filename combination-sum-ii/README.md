Given a collection of candidate numbers (C) and a target number (T), find all unique combinations in C where the candidate numbers sums to T.  

Each number in C may only be used once in the combination.  

Note:  
-   All numbers (including target) will be positive integers.
-   The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.

    For example, given candidate set [10, 1, 2, 7, 6, 1, 5] and target 8, 
    A solution set is: 
    [
      [1, 7],
      [1, 2, 5],
      [2, 6],
      [1, 1, 6]
    ]
