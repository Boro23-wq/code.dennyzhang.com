Given a picture consisting of black and white pixels, and a positive integer N, find the number of black pixels located at some specific row R and column C that align with all the following rules:  

Row R and column C both contain exactly N black pixels.  
For all rows that have a black pixel at column C, they should be exactly the same as row R  
The picture is represented by a 2D char array consisting of 'B' and 'W', which means black and white pixels respectively.  

Example:  

    Input:                                            
    [['W', 'B', 'W', 'B', 'B', 'W'],    
     ['W', 'B', 'W', 'B', 'B', 'W'],    
     ['W', 'B', 'W', 'B', 'B', 'W'],    
     ['W', 'W', 'B', 'W', 'B', 'W']] 
    
    N = 3
    Output: 6
    Explanation: All the bold 'B' are the black pixels we need (all 'B's at column 1 and 3).
            0    1    2    3    4    5         column index                                            
    0    [['W', 'B', 'W', 'B', 'B', 'W'],    
    1     ['W', 'B', 'W', 'B', 'B', 'W'],    
    2     ['W', 'B', 'W', 'B', 'B', 'W'],    
    3     ['W', 'W', 'B', 'W', 'B', 'W']]    
    row index
    
    Take 'B' at row R = 0 and column C = 1 as an example:
    Rule 1, row R = 0 and column C = 1 both have exactly N = 3 black pixels. 
    Rule 2, the rows have black pixel at column C = 1 are row 0, row 1 and row 2. They are exactly the same as row R = 0.

Note:  
The range of width and height of the input 2D array is [1,200].
