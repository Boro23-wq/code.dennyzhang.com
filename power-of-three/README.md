Leave me comments, if you know how to solve.  

    class Solution(object):
    ## Basic Ideas: power of any prime number
    ##              3 is a prime
    ##              If 3 % k == 0 and k is a prime, then k is 3.
    ##              Thus 3^19 % n === 0 means n is power of 3
    class Solution(object):
        def isPowerOfThree(self, n):
            """
            :type n: int
            :rtype: bool
            """
            if n <= 0:
                return False
            larget_power3 = pow(3, 19)
            return larget_power3 % n == 0
