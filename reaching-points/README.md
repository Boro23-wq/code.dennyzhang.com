A move consists of taking a point (x, y) and transforming it to either (x, x+y) or (x+y, y).  

Given a starting point (sx, sy) and a target point (tx, ty), return True if and only if a sequence of moves exists to transform the point (sx, sy) to (tx, ty). Otherwise, return False.  

    Examples:
    Input: sx = 1, sy = 1, tx = 3, ty = 5
    Output: True
    Explanation:
    One series of moves that transforms the starting point to the target is:
    (1, 1) -> (1, 2)
    (1, 2) -> (3, 2)
    (3, 2) -> (3, 5)
    
    Input: sx = 1, sy = 1, tx = 2, ty = 2
    Output: False
    
    Input: sx = 1, sy = 1, tx = 1, ty = 1
    Output: True

Note:  

sx, sy, tx, ty will all be integers in the range [1, 10^9].
