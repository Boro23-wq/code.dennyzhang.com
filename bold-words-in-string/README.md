---

Given a set of keywords words and a string S, make all appearances of all keywords in S bold. Any letters between <b> and </b> tags become bold.  

The returned string should use the least number of tags possible, and of course the tags should form a valid combination.  

For example, given that words = ["ab", "bc"] and S = "aabcd", we should return "a<b>abc</b>d". Note that returning "a<b>a<b>b</b>c</b>d" would use more tags, so it is incorrect.  

Note:  

1.  words has length in range [0, 50].
2.  words[i] has length in range [1, 10].
3.  S has length in range [0, 500].
4.  All characters in words[i] and S are lowercase letters.
