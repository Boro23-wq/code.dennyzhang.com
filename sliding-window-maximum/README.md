Given an array nums, there is a sliding window of size k which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the k numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position.  

For example,  

    Given nums = [1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7], and k = 3.
    
    Window position                Max
    ---------------               -----
    [1  3  -1] -3  5  3  6  7       3
     1 [3  -1  -3] 5  3  6  7       3
     1  3 [-1  -3  5] 3  6  7       5
     1  3  -1 [-3  5  3] 6  7       5
     1  3  -1  -3 [5  3  6] 7       6
     1  3  -1  -3  5 [3  6  7]      7
    Therefore, return the max sliding window as [3,3,5,5,6,7].

Note:  
You may assume k is always valid, ie: 1 <= k <= input array's size for non-empty array.

Could you solve it in linear time?
