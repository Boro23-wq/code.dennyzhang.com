Given a list of 24-hour clock time points in "Hour:Minutes" format, find the minimum minutes difference between any two time points in the list.  
Example 1:  

    Input: ["23:59","00:00"]
    Output: 1

Note:  
1.  The number of time points in the given list is at least 2 and won't exceed 20000.
2.  The input time is legal and ranges from 00:00 to 23:59.

    ## Blog link: https://brain.dennyzhang.com/minimum-time-difference
    ## Basic Ideas: Convert string to integer. 
    ##              Sort it. Then get difference with rotation enforced
    ##
    ## Complexity: Time O(1), Space O(1). There are only 60*24 possibilities.
