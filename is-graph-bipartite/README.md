Given a graph, return true if and only if it is bipartite.  

Recall that a graph is bipartite if we can split it's set of nodes into two independent subsets A and B such that every edge in the graph has one node in A and another node in B.  

The graph is given in the following form: graph[i] is a list of indexes j for which the edge between nodes i and j exists.  Each node is an integer between 0 and graph.length - 1.  There are no self edges or parallel edges: graph[i] does not contain i, and it doesn't contain any element twice.  

    Example 1:
    Input: [[1,3], [0,2], [1,3], [0,2]]
    Output: true
    Explanation: 
    The graph looks like this:
    0----1
    |    |
    |    |
    3----2
    We can divide the vertices into two groups: {0, 2} and {1, 3}.

    Example 2:
    Input: [[1,2,3], [0,2], [0,1,3], [0,2]]
    Output: false
    Explanation: 
    The graph looks like this:
    0----1
    | \  |
    |  \ |
    3----2
    
    We cannot find a way to divide the set of nodes into two independent subsets.

Note:  

-   graph will have length in range [1, 100].
-   graph[i] will contain integers in range [0, graph.length - 1].
-   graph[i] will not contain i or duplicate values.

        ##      For two forests, we can put the first nodes into the same set.
