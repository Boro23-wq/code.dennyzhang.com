Given a binary tree, collect a tree's nodes as if you were doing this: Collect and remove all leaves, repeat until the tree is empty.  

Example:  

    Given binary tree 
              1
             / \
            2   3
           / \     
          4   5    
    Returns [4, 5, 3], [2], [1].

Explanation:  

    1. Removing the leaves [4, 5, 3] would result in this tree:
              1
             / 
            2

    2. Now removing the leaf [2] would result in this tree:
              1

    3. Now removing the leaf [1] would result in the empty tree:
              []         
    Returns [4, 5, 3], [2], [1].
