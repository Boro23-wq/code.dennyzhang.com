There are N children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value.  

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:  

Each child must have at least one candy.

    ## Blog link: https://brain.dennyzhang.com/candy
    ## Basic Ideas:
    ##
    ##   Assign each child 1 candy
    ##   From left to right, if the latter one has a bigger value, change the latter value
    ##   From right to left, if the former one has a bigger value, change the former value
    ##   Collect the result
    ##
    ##   Assumption: if the same rating, they don't have to get the same amount of candies
    ## Complexity: Time O(n), Space O(n)
    class Solution:
        def candy(self, ratings):
            """
            :type ratings: List[int]
            :rtype: int
            """
            length = len(ratings)
            l = [1] * length
            for i in range(length-1):
                if ratings[i+1] > ratings[i]: l[i+1] = l[i]+1
    
            for i in range(length-1, 0, -1):
                if ratings[i-1] > ratings[i] and l[i-1]<=l[i]:
                    l[i-1] = l[i]+1
    
            return sum(l)
