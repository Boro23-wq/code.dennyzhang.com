1-bit and 2-bit Characters  

---

We have two special characters. The first character can be represented by one bit 0. The second character can be represented by two bits (10 or 11).  

Now given a string represented by several bits. Return whether the last character must be a one-bit character or not. The given string will always end with a zero.  

    Example 1:
    Input: 
    bits = [1, 0, 0]
    Output: True
    Explanation: 
    The only way to decode it is two-bit character and one-bit character. So the last character is one-bit character.

    Example 2:
    Input: 
    bits = [1, 1, 1, 0]
    Output: False
    Explanation: 
    The only way to decode it is two-bit character and two-bit character. So the last character is NOT one-bit character.

Note:  

-   1 <= len(bits) <= 1000.
-   bits[i] is always 0 or 1.

    ## Basic Ideas: One pass
    ##       If current digit is 0, move 1 step
    ##       If current digit is 1, move 2 steps
    ##       Check whether the last match is 1 step
    ##       Note: since the last digit is 0, the given string can always match
    ## Complexity: Time O(n), Space O(1)
