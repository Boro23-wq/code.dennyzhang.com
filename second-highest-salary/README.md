Write a SQL query to get the second highest salary from the Employee table.  

    +----+--------+
    | Id | Salary |
    +----+--------+
    | 1  | 100    |
    | 2  | 200    |
    | 3  | 300    |
    +----+--------+

For example, given the above Employee table, the query should return 200 as the second highest salary. If there is no second highest salary, then the query should return null.

    | SecondHighestSalary |
    +---------------------+
    | 200                 |
