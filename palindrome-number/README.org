Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. Do this without extra space.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. Do this without extra space.

Some hints:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Could negative integers be palindromes? (ie, -1)

If you are thinking of converting the integer to string, note the restriction of using extra space.

You could also try reversing an integer. However, if you have solved
the problem "Reverse Integer", you know that the reversed integer
might overflow. How would you handle such case?

There is a more generic way of solving this problem.

## Basic Ideas:  Generate a new integer Y from right digit to left digit
##               Then compare it with X
##         1234321: 1 -> 12 -> 13 -> 134 ...
## Complexity: Time O(1), Space O(1). The integer can be at most 32 digits
