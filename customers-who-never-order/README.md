Suppose that a website contains two tables, the Customers table and the Orders table. Write a SQL query to find all customers who never order anything.  

Table: Customers.  

    +----+-------+
    | Id | Name  |
    +----+-------+
    | 1  | Joe   |
    | 2  | Henry |
    | 3  | Sam   |
    | 4  | Max   |
    +----+-------+

Table: Orders.  

    +----+------------+
    | Id | CustomerId |
    +----+------------+
    | 1  | 3          |
    | 2  | 1          |
    +----+------------+

Using the above tables as example, return the following:  

    +-----------+
    | Customers |
    +-----------+
    | Henry     |
    | Max       |
    +-----------+
