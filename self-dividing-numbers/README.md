# Leetcode: Self Dividing Numbers     :BLOG:Medium:


---

A self-dividing number is a number that is divisible by every digit it contains.  

---

A self-dividing number is a number that is divisible by every digit it contains.  

For example, 128 is a self-dividing number because 128 % 1 `= 0, 128 % 2 =` 0, and 128 % 8 == 0.  

Also, a self-dividing number is not allowed to contain the digit zero.  

Given a lower and upper number bound, output a list of every possible self dividing number, including the bounds if possible.  

    Example 1:
    Input: 
    left = 1, right = 22
    Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 15, 22]

Note:  

The boundaries of each input argument are 1 <= left <= right <= 10000.
