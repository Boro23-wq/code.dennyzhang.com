Given a non-empty array of integers, return the third maximum number in this array. If it does not exist, return the maximum number. The time complexity must be in O(n).  

    Example 1:
    Input: [3, 2, 1]
    
    Output: 1
    
    Explanation: The third maximum is 1.

    Example 2:
    Input: [1, 2]
    
    Output: 2
    
    Explanation: The third maximum does not exist, so the maximum (2) is returned instead.

    Example 3:
    Input: [2, 2, 3, 1]
    
    Output: 1
    
    Explanation: Note that the third maximum here means the third maximum distinct number.
    Both numbers with value 2 are both considered as second maximum.
