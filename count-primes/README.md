    ## Basic Ideas: Sieve of Eratosthenes
    ##              If n is not a prime, it will have more than 1 dividends.
    ##              One of the dividend must less than sqrt(n)
    ##              1. Find primes from 2 to sqrt(n)
    ##              2. Mark the elements as not prime
    ##              3. The elements which are not visited are prime

    ## Complexity:
    class Solution(object):
        def countPrimes(self, n):
            """
            :type n: int
            :rtype: int
            """
            if n <= 2:
                return 0
            l = [1] * n
            # l[i] indicate i
            i = 2
            while i*i < n:
                j = 2
                # mark non-prime
                while j*i<n:
                    l[j*i] = 0
                    j += 1
                # move to next prime
                i += 1
                while l[i] == 0 and i*i<n:
                    i += 1
            return sum(l[2::])
