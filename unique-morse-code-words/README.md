International Morse Code defines a standard encoding where each letter is mapped to a series of dots and dashes, as follows: "a" maps to ".-", "b" maps to "-&#x2026;", "c" maps to "-.-.", and so on.  

For convenience, the full table for the 26 letters of the English alphabet is given below:  

    [".-","-...","-.-.","-..",".","..-.","--.","....","..",".---","-.-",".-..","--","-.","---",".--.","--.-",".-.","...","-","..-","...-",".--","-..-","-.--","--.."]

Now, given a list of words, each word can be written as a concatenation of the Morse code of each letter. For example, "cab" can be written as "-.-.-&#x2026;.-", (which is the concatenation "-.-." + "-&#x2026;" + ".-"). We'll call such a concatenation, the transformation of a word.  

Return the number of different transformations among all words we have.  

Example:  

    Input: words = ["gin", "zen", "gig", "msg"]
    Output: 2
    Explanation: 
    The transformation of each word is:
    "gin" -> "--...-."
    "zen" -> "--...-."
    "gig" -> "--...--."
    "msg" -> "--...--."

There are 2 different transformations, "&#x2013;&#x2026;-." and "&#x2013;&#x2026;&#x2013;.".  

Note:  

-   The length of words will be at most 100.
-   Each words[i] will have length in range [1, 12].
-   words[i] will only consist of lowercase letters.
