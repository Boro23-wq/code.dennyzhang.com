You are given a binary tree in which each node contains an integer value.  

Find the number of paths that sum to a given value.  

The path does not need to start or end at the root or a leaf, but it must go downwards (traveling only from parent nodes to child nodes).  

The tree has no more than 1,000 nodes and the values are in the range -1,000,000 to 1,000,000.  

    Example:
    
    root = [10,5,-3,3,2,null,11,3,-2,null,1], sum = 8
    
          10
         /  \
        5   -3
       / \    \
      3   2   11
     / \   \
    3  -2   1
    
    Return 3. The paths that sum to 8 are:
    
    1.  5 -> 3
    2.  5 -> 2 -> 1
    3. -3 -> 11
