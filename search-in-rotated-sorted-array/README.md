Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.  

(i.e., 0 1 2 4 5 6 7 might become 4 5 6 7 0 1 2).  

You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its index, otherwise return -1.  

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

Leave me comments, if you have better ways to solve.  

    ## Blog link: https://brain.dennyzhang.com/search-in-rotated-sorted-array
    ## Basic Ideas: Binary search
    ##  Find the pivot. And do two binary search
    ## Complexity: Time O(log(n)), Space O(1)
