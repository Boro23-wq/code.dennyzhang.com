Given a text file file.txt that contains list of phone numbers (one per line), write a one liner bash script to print all valid phone numbers.  

You may assume that a valid phone number must appear in one of the following two formats: (xxx) xxx-xxxx or xxx-xxx-xxxx. (x means a digit)  

You may also assume each line in the text file must not contain leading or trailing white spaces.  

For example, assume that file.txt has the following content:  

    987-123-4567
    123 456 7890
    (123) 456-7890

Your script should output the following valid phone numbers:  

    987-123-4567
    (123) 456-7890
