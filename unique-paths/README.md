A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).  

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).  

How many possible unique paths are there?

Above is a 3 x 7 grid. How many possible unique paths are there?  

Note: m and n will be at most 100.
