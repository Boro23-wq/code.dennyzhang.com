A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).  

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).  

How many possible unique paths are there?

Above is a 3 x 7 grid. How many possible unique paths are there?  

Note: m and n will be at most 100.

    ## Blog link: http://brain.dennyzhang.com/unique-paths
    ## Basic Ideas: Dynamic programming
    ##              For the previous step of finish point, it should come from either up or left
    ##              f(i, j) = f(i-1, j) + f(j, j-1)

    ## Complexity: Time O(m*n), Space O(m*n)
