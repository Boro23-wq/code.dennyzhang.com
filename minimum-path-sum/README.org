Minimum Path Sum
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Given a m x n grid filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top left to bottom right which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path.

Note: You can only move either down or right at any point in time.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Example 1:
[[1,3,1],
 [1,5,1],
 [4,2,1]]
Given the above grid map, return 7. Because the path 1->3->1->1->1 minimizes the sum.

## Basic Ideas:
##           For point grid[i][j], think about the prevoius step of the minimize path
##           It should come from either grid[i-1][j] or grid[i][j-1].
##
##           So f(i, j) can be calculated from f(i-1, j) and f(i, j-1)
##           
##           Do we have to use the extra space to save the intermediate results?
##           No, we can reuse the original matrix
##
## Complexity: Time O(m*n), Space O(1)
