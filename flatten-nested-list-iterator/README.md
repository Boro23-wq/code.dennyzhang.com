Flatten Nested List Iterator  

---

Given a nested list of integers, implement an iterator to flatten it.  

Each element is either an integer, or a list &#x2013; whose elements may also be integers or other lists.  

    Example 1:
    Given the list [[1,1],2,[1,1]],
    
    By calling next repeatedly until hasNext returns false, the order of elements returned by next should be: [1,1,2,1,1].

    Example 2:
    Given the list [1,[4,[6]]],
    
    By calling next repeatedly until hasNext returns false, the order of elements returned by next should be: [1,4,6].
