# Puzzle: Find the Duplicate Number     :BLOG:Numbers:


---

Find the only one duplicate number  

---

Given an array nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is between 1 and n (inclusive), prove that at least one duplicate number must exist. Assume that there is only one duplicate number, find the duplicate one.  

Note:  
1.  You must not modify the array (assume the array is read only).
2.  You must use only constant, O(1) extra space.
3.  Your runtime complexity should be less than O(n\*n).
4.  There is only one duplicate number in the array, but it could be repeated more than once.
