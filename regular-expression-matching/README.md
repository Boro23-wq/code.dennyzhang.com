Implement regular expression matching with support for '.' and '\*'.  

    '.' Matches any single character.
    '*' Matches zero or more of the preceding element.
    
    The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial).
    
    The function prototype should be:
    bool isMatch(const char *s, const char *p)
    
    Some examples:
    isMatch("aa","a") -> false
    isMatch("aa","aa") -> true
    isMatch("aaa","aa") -> false
    isMatch("aa", "a*") -> true
    isMatch("aa", ".*") -> true
    isMatch("ab", ".*") -> true
    isMatch("aab", "c*a*b") -> true
