Number Complement  

---

Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.  

Note:  
The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.  
You could assume no leading zero bit in the integer's binary representation.  

    Example 1:
    Input: 5
    Output: 2
    Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.

    Example 2:
    Input: 1
    Output: 0
    Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.
