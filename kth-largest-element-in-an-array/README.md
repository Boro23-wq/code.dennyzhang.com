Kth Largest Element in an Array  

---

Find the kth largest element in an unsorted array. Note that it is the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.  
For example,  
Given [3,2,1,5,6,4] and k = 2, return 5.  

Note:  
You may assume k is always valid, 1 <= k <= array's length.
