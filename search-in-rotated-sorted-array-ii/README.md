Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.  

(i.e., 0 1 2 4 5 6 7 might become 4 5 6 7 0 1 2).  

Write a function to determine if a given target is in the array.  

The array may contain duplicates.

    ## Complexity: Time O(n), Space O(1)
    class Solution:

            for num in nums:
                if num == target: return True
            return False
