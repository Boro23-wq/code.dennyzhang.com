## Lesson learned from Cracking leetcode.com
- Learn to write bug-free code. Test-driven may lead you to waste time? If you think clearly and pass with once
- Understand data structure and common library in your languages: Python TreeNode, Python Interval
- Write your idea, before you coding. Update time/space complexity in advance.
- Know how to use library. Thus we can think and design in a higher layer. But make sure you can evaluate the time and space performance
- Think in a natural way, instead of a complicated way
- Time complexity of n is similar to 2n, but it's 100% faster in our real production!
