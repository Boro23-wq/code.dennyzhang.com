The gray code is a binary numeral system where two successive values differ in only one bit.  

Given a non-negative integer n representing the total number of bits in the code, print the sequence of gray code. A gray code sequence must begin with 0.  

    For example, given n = 2, return [0,1,3,2]. Its gray code sequence is:
    
    00 - 0
    01 - 1
    11 - 3
    10 - 2

Note:  
For a given n, a gray code sequence is not uniquely defined.  

For example, [0,2,3,1] is also a valid gray code sequence according to the above definition.  

For now, the judge is able to judge based on one instance of gray code sequence. Sorry about that.
