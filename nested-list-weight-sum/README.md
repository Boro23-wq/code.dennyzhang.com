Given a nested list of integers, return the sum of all integers in the list weighted by their depth.  

Each element is either an integer, or a list &#x2013; whose elements may also be integers or other lists.  

Example 1:  

    Given the list [[1,1],2,[1,1]], return 10. (four 1's at depth 2, one 2 at depth 1)

Example 2:  

    Given the list [1,[4,[6]]], return 27. (one 1 at depth 1, one 4 at depth 2, and one 6 at depth 3; 1 + 4*2 + 6*3 = 27)
