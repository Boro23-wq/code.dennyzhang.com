Intersection of Two Linked Lists  

---

Write a program to find the node at which the intersection of two singly linked lists begins.  

For example, the following two linked lists:  

    A:          a1 -> a2
                        \
                         c1 -> c2 -> c3
                       /            
    B:     b1 -> b2 -> b3
    begin to intersect at node c1.

Notes:  

-   If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return null.
-   The linked lists must retain their original structure after the function returns.
-   You may assume there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.
-   Your code should preferably run in O(n) time and use only O(1) memory.

    ## Basic Ideas: get the count of two links
    ##       Skip the longer link with a proper offset.
    ##       Then compare two links node by node
    ## Complexity: Time O(n), Space O(1)
