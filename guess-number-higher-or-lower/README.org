We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number is higher or lower.

You call a pre-defined API guess(int num) which returns 3 possible results (-1, 1, or 0):
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
-1 : My number is lower
 1 : My number is higher
 0 : Congrats! You got it!
#+END_EXAMPLE

Example:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
n = 10, I pick 6.

Return 6.
#+END_EXAMPLE

        if num <= 1:
            return False

        sum = 1
        for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(num))+1):
            if num % i == 0:
                sum += i
                if i != num/i:
                    sum += num/i
        return sum == num
