Subsets II  

---

Given a collection of integers that might contain duplicates, nums, return all possible subsets (the power set).  

Note: The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets.  

    For example,
    If nums = [1,2,2], a solution is:
    
    [
      [2],
      [1],
      [1,2,2],
      [2,2],
      [1,2],
      []
    ]
