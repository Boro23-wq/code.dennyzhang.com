TinyURL is a URL shortening service where you enter a URL such as [<https://leetcode.com/problems/design-tinyurl>](https://leetcode.com/problems/design-tinyurl) and it returns a short URL such as [<http://tinyurl.com/4e9iAk>](http://tinyurl.com/4e9iAk).  

Design the encode and decode methods for the TinyURL service. There is no restriction on how your encode/decode algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a URL can be encoded to a tiny URL and the tiny URL can be decoded to the original URL.
