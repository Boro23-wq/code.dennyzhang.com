Write a function that add two numbers A and B. You should not use + or any arithmetic operators.  

Notice  
There is no need to read data from standard input stream. Both parameters are given in function aplusb, you job is to calculate the sum and return it.  

Have you met this question in a real interview?  
Clarification  
Are a and b both 32-bit integers?  

Yes.  
Can I use bit operation?  

Sure you can.  
Example  
Given a=1 and b=2 return 3

            ## Basic Ideas:
            ##
            ##   a ^ b: add without carry
            ##   (a & b) << 1: carry
            ##
            ##  Assumption: the result won't overflow
            ##
            ## Complexity: Time O(1), Space O(1)
            mod = 0xFFFFFFFF
            while b != 0:
                a, b = (a ^ b) & mod, ((a & b) << 1) & mod
            return a
