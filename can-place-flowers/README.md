Suppose you have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted and some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in adjacent plots - they would compete for water and both would die.  

Given a flowerbed (represented as an array containing 0 and 1, where 0 means empty and 1 means not empty), and a number n, return if n new flowers can be planted in it without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule.  

    Example 1:
    Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 1
    Output: True

    Example 2:
    Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 2
    Output: False

Note:  
1.  The input array won't violate no-adjacent-flowers rule.
2.  The input array size is in the range of [1, 20000].
3.  n is a non-negative integer which won't exceed the input array size.

    ## Basic Ideas: Find consecutive 0s
    ##              For a range of n 0s
    ##                  If the range in the middle, we can place (n-1)/2 flowers
    ##              Add a virtual '0' to the head, add a virtual '0' and '1' to the end

    ## Complexity: Time O(n), Space O(1)
