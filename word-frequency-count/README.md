Description  
Input a string s and a string list excludeList to find all the most frequent words in s that do not exist in excludeList. Your results will be sorted by lexicographic order by online judge.  

The words are case-insensitive and finally return lowercase words  
Non-alphabetic characters in the string are considered as spaces, and spaces are word separators  
The length of all words does not exceed 10^5​​  and the length a word does not exceed 100  

Example  

    Given s="I love Amazon.", excludeList=[] , return ["i","love","amazon"].
    
    Explanation:
    "i", "love", and "amazon" are the words that appear the most.

    Given s="Do not trouble trouble.", excludeList=["do"], return ["trouble"].
    
    Explanation:
    "trouble" is the most frequently occurring word.
