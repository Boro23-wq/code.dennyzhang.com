# Leetcode: Valid Anagram     :BLOG:Basic:


---

Given two strings s and t, write a function to determine if t is an anagram of s.  

---

Given two strings s and t, write a function to determine if t is an anagram of s.  

    For example,
    s = "anagram", t = "nagaram", return true.
    s = "rat", t = "car", return false.

Note:  
You may assume the string contains only lowercase alphabets.  

Follow up:  
What if the inputs contain unicode characters? How would you adapt your solution to such case?
