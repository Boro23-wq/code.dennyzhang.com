Given two strings S and T, return if they are equal when both are typed into empty text editors. # means a backspace character.  

Example 1:  

    Input: S = "ab#c", T = "ad#c"
    Output: true
    Explanation: Both S and T become "ac".

Example 2:  

    Input: S = "ab##", T = "c#d#"
    Output: true
    Explanation: Both S and T become "".

Example 3:  

    Input: S = "a##c", T = "#a#c"
    Output: true
    Explanation: Both S and T become "c".

Example 4:  

    Input: S = "a#c", T = "b"
    Output: false
    Explanation: S becomes "c" while T becomes "b".

Note:  

1.  1 <= S.length <= 200
2.  1 <= T.length <= 200
3.  S and T only contain lowercase letters and '#' characters.
