Mary is a teacher in a middle school and she has a table seat storing students' names and their corresponding seat ids.  

The column id is continuous increment.  
Mary wants to change seats for the adjacent students.  
Can you write a SQL query to output the result for Mary?  

    +---------+---------+
    |    id   | student |
    +---------+---------+
    |    1    | Abbot   |
    |    2    | Doris   |
    |    3    | Emerson |
    |    4    | Green   |
    |    5    | Jeames  |
    +---------+---------+

For the sample input, the output is:  

    +---------+---------+
    |    id   | student |
    +---------+---------+
    |    1    | Doris   |
    |    2    | Abbot   |
    |    3    | Green   |
    |    4    | Emerson |
    |    5    | Jeames  |
    +---------+---------+

Note:  
If the number of students is odd, there is no need to change the last one's seat.
