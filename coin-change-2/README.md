You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money. Write a function to compute the number of combinations that make up that amount. You may assume that you have infinite number of each kind of coin.  

Note: You can assume that  

-   0 <= amount <= 5000
-   1 <= coin <= 5000
-   the number of coins is less than 500
-   the answer is guaranteed to fit into signed 32-bit integer

Example 1:  

    Input: amount = 5, coins = [1, 2, 5]
    Output: 4
    Explanation: there are four ways to make up the amount:
    5=5
    5=2+2+1
    5=2+1+1+1
    5=1+1+1+1+1

Example 2:  

    Input: amount = 3, coins = [2]
    Output: 0
    Explanation: the amount of 3 cannot be made up just with coins of 2.

Example 3:  

    Input: amount = 10, coins = [10] 
    Output: 1
