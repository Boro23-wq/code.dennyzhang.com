You are climbing a stair case. It takes n steps to reach to the top.  

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?  

Note: Given n will be a positive integer.  

Example 1:  

    Input: 2
    Output:  2
    Explanation:  There are two ways to climb to the top.
    
    1. 1 step + 1 step
    2. 2 steps

Example 2:  

    Input: 3
    Output:  3
    Explanation:  There are three ways to climb to the top.
    
    1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
    2. 1 step + 2 steps
    3. 2 steps + 1 step
