Given a binary tree where all the right nodes are either leaf nodes with a sibling (a left node that shares the same parent node) or empty, flip it upside down and turn it into a tree where the original right nodes turned into left leaf nodes. Return the new root.  

For example:  

    Given a binary tree {1,2,3,4,5},
        1
       / \
      2   3
     / \
    4   5

return the root of the binary tree [4,5,2,#,#,3,1].  

      4
     / \
    5   2
       / \
      3   1
