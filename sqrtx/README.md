Implement int sqrt(int x).  

Compute and return the square root of x.  

x is guaranteed to be a non-negative integer.  

    Example 1:
    
    Input: 4
    Output: 2

    Example 2:
    
    Input: 8
    Output: 2
    Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since we want to return an integer, the decimal part will be truncated.
