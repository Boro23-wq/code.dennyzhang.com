Maximum Length of Repeated Subarray  

---

Given two integer arrays A and B, return the maximum length of an subarray that appears in both arrays.  

    Example 1:
    Input:
    A: [1,2,3,2,1]
    B: [3,2,1,4,7]
    Output: 3
    Explanation:
    The repeated subarray with maximum length is [3, 2, 1].

Note:  
-   1 <= len(A), len(B) <= 1000
-   0 <= A[i], B[i] < 100
