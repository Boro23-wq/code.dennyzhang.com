We are given an array asteroids of integers representing asteroids in a row.

For each asteroid, the absolute value represents its size, and the sign represents its direction (positive meaning right, negative meaning left). Each asteroid moves at the same speed.

Find out the state of the asteroids after all collisions. If two asteroids meet, the smaller one will explode. If both are the same size, both will explode. Two asteroids moving in the same direction will never meet.

Example 1:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Input: 
asteroids = [5, 10, -5]
Output: [5, 10]
Explanation: 
The 10 and -5 collide resulting in 10.  The 5 and 10 never collide.
#+END_EXAMPLE

Example 2:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Input: 
asteroids = [8, -8]
Output: []
Explanation: 
The 8 and -8 collide exploding each other.
#+END_EXAMPLE

Example 3:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Input: 
asteroids = [10, 2, -5]
Output: [10]
Explanation: 
The 2 and -5 collide resulting in -5.  The 10 and -5 collide resulting in 10.
#+END_EXAMPLE

Example 4:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Input: 
asteroids = [-2, -1, 1, 2]
Output: [-2, -1, 1, 2]
Explanation: 
The -2 and -1 are moving left, while the 1 and 2 are moving right.
Asteroids moving the same direction never meet, so no asteroids will meet each other.
#+END_EXAMPLE
Note:

- The length of asteroids will be at most 10000.
- Each asteroid will be a non-zero integer in the range [-1000, 1000]..

## Blog link: https://code.dennyzhang.com/asteroid-collision
## Basic Ideas: stack
##       Scan from left to right. 
##       If the element is positive, push
##       If the element is negative, check with the stack top
##              If collision is detected, make the decision
##                 If top element is smaller size, keep the loop
##
##   Sample data: [-1, 1]. It won't collide
##                [1, -1]. Both will explode
##
## Complexity: Time O(n), Space O(n)
