Given a non-empty array of non-negative integers nums, the degree of this array is defined as the maximum frequency of any one of its elements.

Your task is to find the smallest possible length of a (contiguous) subarray of nums, that has the same degree as nums.

Example 1:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Input: [1, 2, 2, 3, 1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
The input array has a degree of 2 because both elements 1 and 2 appear twice.
Of the subarrays that have the same degree:
[1, 2, 2, 3, 1], [1, 2, 2, 3], [2, 2, 3, 1], [1, 2, 2], [2, 2, 3], [2, 2]
The shortest length is 2. So return 2.
#+END_EXAMPLE

Example 2:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Input: [1,2,2,3,1,4,2]
Output: 6
#+END_EXAMPLE

Note:

- nums.length will be between 1 and 50,000.
- nums[i] will be an integer between 0 and 49,999.
