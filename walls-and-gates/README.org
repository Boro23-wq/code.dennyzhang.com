You are given a m x n 2D grid initialized with these three possible values.

1. -1 - A wall or an obstacle.
- 0 - A gate.
- INF - Infinity means an empty room. We use the value 231 - 1 = 2147483647 to represent INF as you may assume that the distance to a gate is less than 2147483647.

Fill each empty room with the distance to its nearest gate. If it is impossible to reach a gate, it should be filled with INF.

For example, given the 2D grid:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
INF  -1  0  INF
INF INF INF  -1
INF  -1 INF  -1
  0  -1 INF INF
#+END_EXAMPLE

After running your function, the 2D grid should be:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  3  -1   0   1
  2   2   1  -1
  1  -1   2  -1
  0  -1   3   4

## Blog link: https://brain.dennyzhang.com/walls-and-gates
## Basic Ideas: BFS
##      For each 0, and configure the values to the level number
##      If the neighbors is 0 or value equals current level, skip them
##
## Complexity: Time O(?), Space O(n*n)
