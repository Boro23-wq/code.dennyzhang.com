Given an integer n, generate all structurally unique BST's (binary search trees) that store values 1&#x2026;n.  

    For example,
    Given n = 3, your program should return all 5 unique BST's shown below.
    
       1         3     3      2      1
        \       /     /      / \      \
         3     2     1      1   3      2
        /     /       \                 \
       2     1         2                 3
