Given an unsorted array, find the maximum difference between the successive elements in its sorted form.  

Try to solve it in linear time/space.  

Return 0 if the array contains less than 2 elements.  

You may assume all elements in the array are non-negative integers and fit in the 32-bit signed integer range.

-   Solution: bucket sort

**General Thinkings:**  

    Put each element into a list of buckets. Each bucket track the min and max.
    
    The scan the bucket kist, we get the maximum gap.
    
    Some improvements:
    To get the mininum bucket count, we avoid placing min and max into any buckets.
    
    Bucket count: n-1, bucket size: int((max-min)/(n-1))

**Walk Through Testdata**

**Key Observations:**  

    - Duplicate elements doesn't matter
    - Instead of total order, we maintain partial order in bucket-sort. 
      Actually we don't even sort. We can compare items with pilots
