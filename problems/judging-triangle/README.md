Description  
Given an array arr, ask if you can find 3 elements from the array as the sides of the three sides, so that the three sides can form a triangle. If yes, return yes, if not, return no  

-   1 <= n<= 100000
-   1 <= arr[i] <= 1000000000
-   The program will be run 500 times

Example  

Give arr=[2,3,5,8], return no.  

    Explanation:
    2, 3, 5 cannot form a triangle
    2, 3, 8 cannot form a triangle
    3, 5, 8 cannot form a triangle
    So, return "no"

Give arr=[3,4,5,8] , return yes.  

    Explanation:
    3, 4, 5 can form a triangle
    So return "yes"
