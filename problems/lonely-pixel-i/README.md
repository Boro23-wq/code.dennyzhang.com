Given a picture consisting of black and white pixels, find the number of black lonely pixels.  

The picture is represented by a 2D char array consisting of 'B' and 'W', which means black and white pixels respectively.  

A black lonely pixel is character 'B' that located at a specific position where the same row and same column don't have any other black pixels.  

Example:  

    Input: 
    [['W', 'W', 'B'],
     ['W', 'B', 'W'],
     ['B', 'W', 'W']]
    
    Output: 3
    Explanation: All the three 'B's are black lonely pixels.

Note:  
The range of width and height of the input 2D array is [1,500].

    ## Blog link: https://code.dennyzhang.com/lonely-pixel-i
    ## Basic Ideas:
    ##   Maintain two array, with initial value of 0
    ##     row_list: how many B for each row
    ##     col_list: how many B for each col
    ##
    ## Complexity: Time O(n*m), Space O(n+m)
