Given a string, we can "shift" each of its letter to its successive letter, for example: "abc" -> "bcd". We can keep "shifting" which forms the sequence:  

    "abc" -> "bcd" -> ... -> "xyz"

Given a list of strings which contains only lowercase alphabets, group all strings that belong to the same shifting sequence.  

For example, given: ["abc", "bcd", "acef", "xyz", "az", "ba", "a", "z"],  
A solution is:  

    [
      ["abc","bcd","xyz"],
      ["az","ba"],
      ["acef"],
      ["a","z"]
    ]

    ## Blog link: https://code.dennyzhang.com/group-shifted-strings
    ## Basic Ideas: hashmap
    ##
    ## From ["az", "ba"] we know, it's a rotated shift
    ## Assumptions:
    ##  No empty string
    ##  The order doesn't matter
    ##
    ## Complexity: Time O(n), Space O(n)
    class Solution:
        def groupStrings(self, strings):
    	"""
    	:type strings: List[str]
    	:rtype: List[List[str]]
    	"""
    	import collections
    	m = collections.defaultdict(list)
    	for s in strings:
    	    # ba -> (0, 25)
    	    # az -> (0, 25)
    	    tup = tuple([(ord(ch)-ord(s[0]))%26 for ch in s])
    	    m[tup].append(s)
    	return [m[key] for key in m]
