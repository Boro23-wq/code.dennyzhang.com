Given a list of daily temperatures, produce a list that, for each day in the input, tells you how many days you would have to wait until a warmer temperature. If there is no future day for which this is possible, put 0 instead.  

For example, given the list temperatures = [73, 74, 75, 71, 69, 72, 76, 73], your output should be [1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0].  

Note: The length of temperatures will be in the range [1, 30000]. Each temperature will be an integer in the range [30, 100].

    ## Basic Ideas: Monotonous stack can help us find first largest element in O(n) time complexity.
    ##
    ##              Descending stack: find the next bigger nubmer for each element
    ##
    ##              For any given number, if we haven't met the bigger number. We push it to the stack
    ##              If we pop out one element, we do find a bigger number than this element.
    ##
    ## Complexity: Time O(n), Space O(n)
