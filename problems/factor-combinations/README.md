Numbers can be regarded as product of its factors. For example,  

    8 = 2 x 2 x 2;
      = 2 x 4.

Write a function that takes an integer n and return all possible combinations of its factors.  

Note:  

1.  You may assume that n is always positive.
2.  Factors should be greater than 1 and less than n.

Example 1:  

    Input: 1
    Output: []

Example 2:  

    Input: 37
    Output:[]

Example 3:  

    Input: 12
    Output:
    [
      [2, 6],
      [2, 2, 3],
      [3, 4]
    ]

Example 4:  

    Input: 32
    Output:
    [
      [2, 16],
      [2, 2, 8],
      [2, 2, 2, 4],
      [2, 2, 2, 2, 2],
      [2, 4, 4],
      [4, 8]
    ]
