# Leetcode: Summary Ranges     :BLOG:Basic:

---

Combine ranges  

---

Given a sorted integer array without duplicates, return the summary of its ranges.  

    Example 1:
    Input: [0,1,2,4,5,7]
    Output: ["0->2","4->5","7"]

    Example 2:
    Input: [0,2,3,4,6,8,9]
    Output: ["0","2->4","6","8->9"]

    ## Complexity: Time O(n), Space O(1)
    ## Assumptions:
    class Solution(object):
        def summaryRanges(self, nums):
    	"""
    	:type nums: List[int]
    	:rtype: List[str]
    	"""
    	res = []
    	length = len(nums)
    	i=0
    	while i<length:
    	    j = i + 1
    	    while j<length and nums[j] == nums[j-1] + 1:
    		j += 1
    	    if j != i+1:
    		res.append("%d->%d" % (nums[i], nums[j-1]))
    	    else:
    		res.append("%d" % nums[i])
    	    i = j
    	return res
