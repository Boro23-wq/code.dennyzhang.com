Start from integer 1, remove any integer that contains 9 such as 9, 19, 29&#x2026;  

So now, you will have a new integer sequence: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, &#x2026;  

Given a positive integer n, you need to return the n-th integer after removing. Note that 1 will be the first integer.  

    Example 1:
    Input: 9
    Output: 10

Hint: n will not exceed 9 x 10^8.
