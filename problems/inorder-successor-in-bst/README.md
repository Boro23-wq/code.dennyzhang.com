Given a binary search tree and a node in it, find the in-order successor of that node in the BST.  

Note: If the given node has no in-order successor in the tree, return null.  

Example 1:  

    Input: root = [2,1,3], p = 1
    
      2
     / \
    1   3
    
    Output: 2

Example 2:  

    Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,null,1], p = 6
    
          5
         / \
        3   6
       / \
      2   4
     /   
    1
    
    Output: null

-   Solution:

Intuitive Idea would have too many details.  

    ## If p has right child, we can easily find the target in its sub-tree
    ## Otherwise: Use DFS to find all parents of p, from root down to p
    ##    If p is the left-subtree of q, q is the target
    ##    Otherwise keep looking up. If we get the root, return null

    ## Basic Ideas:
    ## 
    ## Complexity:
    # Definition for a binary tree node.
    # class TreeNode(object):
    #     def __init__(self, x):
    #         self.val = x
    #         self.left = None
    #         self.right = None
    
    class Solution(object):
        def inorderSuccessor(self, root, p):
    	"""
    	:type root: TreeNode
    	:type p: TreeNode
    	:rtype: TreeNode
    	"""
    	if p is None or root is None: return None
    	res = None
    	while root:
    	    if root.val > p.val:
    		# go to left
    		res = root
    		root = root.left
    	    else:
    		# go to right
    		root = root.right
    	return res
