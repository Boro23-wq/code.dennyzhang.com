Given an integer matrix, find the length of the longest increasing path.  

From each cell, you can either move to four directions: left, right, up or down. You may NOT move diagonally or move outside of the boundary (i.e. wrap-around is not allowed).  

Example 1:  

    nums = [
      [9,9,4],
      [6,6,8],
      [2,1,1]
    ]
    Return 4
    The longest increasing path is [1, 2, 6, 9].

Example 2:  

    nums = [
      [3,4,5],
      [3,2,6],
      [2,2,1]
    ]
    Return 4
    The longest increasing path is [3, 4, 5, 6]. Moving diagonally is not allowed.
