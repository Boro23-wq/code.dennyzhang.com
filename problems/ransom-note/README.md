Ransom Note  

---

Given an arbitrary ransom note string and another string containing letters from all the magazines, write a function that will return true if the ransom note can be constructed from the magazines ; otherwise, it will return false.  

Each letter in the magazine string can only be used once in your ransom note.  

Note:  
You may assume that both strings contain only lowercase letters.  

    canConstruct("a", "b") -> false
    canConstruct("aa", "ab") -> false
    canConstruct("aa", "aab") -> true
