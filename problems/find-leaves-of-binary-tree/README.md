Given a binary tree, collect a tree's nodes as if you were doing this: Collect and remove all leaves, repeat until the tree is empty.  

Example:  

    Given binary tree 
              1
             / \
            2   3
           / \     
          4   5    
    Returns [4, 5, 3], [2], [1].

Explanation:  

    1. Removing the leaves [4, 5, 3] would result in this tree:
              1
             / 
            2          

    2. Now removing the leaf [2] would result in this tree:
              1  

    3. Now removing the leaf [1] would result in the empty tree:
              []         
    Returns [4, 5, 3], [2], [1].

    ## Basic Ideas: hashmap + post-order + reversed BFS
    ##
    ##  Children find out parent
    ##
    ##  Reversed BFS
    ##   1. Use post-order to initialize queue
    ##   2. Visit current layer in the queue
    ##      Decrease the child count of the parent node by 1
    ##      If the child count of parent node is 0, 
    ##          put them into the queue as the next layer
    ##
    ## Complexity: Time O(n), Space O(n)

    # Definition for a binary tree node.
