Assume you have an array of length n initialized with all 0's and are given k update operations.  

Each operation is represented as a triplet: [startIndex, endIndex, inc] which increments each element of subarray A[startIndex &#x2026; endIndex] (startIndex and endIndex inclusive) with inc.  

Return the modified array after all k operations were executed.  

Example:  

    Given:
    
        length = 5,
        updates = [
            [1,  3,  2],
            [2,  4,  3],
            [0,  2, -2]
        ]
    
    Output:
    
        [-2, 0, 3, 5, 3]

Explanation:  

    Initial state:
    [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ]
    
    After applying operation [1, 3, 2]:
    [ 0, 2, 2, 2, 0 ]
    
    After applying operation [2, 4, 3]:
    [ 0, 2, 5, 5, 3 ]
    
    After applying operation [0, 2, -2]:
    [-2, 0, 3, 5, 3 ]

    ## Basic Ideas:
    ##
    ##         0  0  0  0  0  0    ([1, 3, 2])
    ##         0  2  0  0 -2  0    ([2, 4, 3])
    ##         0  2  3  0 -2 -3    ([0, 2, -2])
    ##        -2  2  3  2 -2 -3
    ## delta: -2  0  3  5  3  0
    ##
    ## Complexity: Time O(n+k), Space O(n)
