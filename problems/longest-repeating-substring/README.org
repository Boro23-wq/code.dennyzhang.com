- Tag: [[https://code.dennyzhang.com/tag/string][#string]]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Given a string str, find the longest substring with no fewer than k repetitions and return the length. The substring can have overlapping parts, but cannot completely overlap.

 Notice
- 1 <= str.length <= 1000
- 1 < k < str.length
- We guarantee that the problem will certainly can be solved

Example
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Given str = "aaa", k = 2, return 2.

Explanation:
The longest subsequence with no fewer than k repetitions is "aa", and the length is 2.
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Given str = "aabcbcbcbc", k = 2, return 6.

Explanation:
Subsequences repeat no fewer than twice are "a", "bc", "bcbc" and "bcbcbc", and the longest is "bcbcbc", and the length is 6.
