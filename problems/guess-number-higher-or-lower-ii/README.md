We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:  

I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.  

Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower.  

However, when you guess a particular number x, and you guess wrong, you pay $x. You win the game when you guess the number I picked.  

Example:  

    n = 10, I pick 8.
    
    First round:  You guess 5, I tell you that it's higher. You pay $5.
    Second round: You guess 7, I tell you that it's higher. You pay $7.
    Third round:  You guess 9, I tell you that it's lower. You pay $9.
    
    Game over. 8 is the number I picked.
    
    You end up paying $5 + $7 + $9 = $21.

Given a particular n >= 1, find out how much money you need to have to guarantee a win.

    //
    // f(i, j) -> money we need to gurantee a win for the range of [i, j]
    //    We will have to start by picking one, let's say it's k.
    //    Then the cost is: k + max(f(i, k-1), f(k+1, j))
    //
    // From bottom to up, from left to right, we can get f(1, n)
    // Complexity: Time O(n*n*n), Space O(n*n)
