You are given a m x n 2D grid initialized with these three possible values.  

1.  -1 - A wall or an obstacle.
2.  0 - A gate.
3.  INF - Infinity means an empty room. We use the value 231 - 1 = 2147483647 to represent INF as you may assume that the distance to a gate is less than 2147483647.

Fill each empty room with the distance to its nearest gate. If it is impossible to reach a gate, it should be filled with INF.  

For example, given the 2D grid:  

    INF  -1  0  INF
    INF INF INF  -1
    INF  -1 INF  -1
      0  -1 INF INF

After running your function, the 2D grid should be:  

    3  -1   0   1
    2   2   1  -1
    1  -1   2  -1
    0  -1   3   4

    ## Blog link: https://code.dennyzhang.com/walls-and-gates
    ## Basic Ideas: BFS
    ##      For each 0, and configure the values to the level number
    ##      If the neighbors is 0 or value equals current level, skip them
    ##
    ## Complexity: Time O(?), Space O(n*n)
    class Solution:
