You're given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels, and S representing the stones you have.  Each character in S is a type of stone you have.  You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.  

The letters in J are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in J and S are letters. Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".  

Example 1:  

    Input: J = "aA", S = "aAAbbbb"
    Output: 3

Example 2:  

    Input: J = "z", S = "ZZ"
    Output: 0

Note:  

-   S and J will consist of letters and have length at most 50.
-   The characters in J are distinct.
