Two strings X and Y are similar if we can swap two letters (in different positions) of X, so that it equals Y.  

For example, "tars" and "rats" are similar (swapping at positions 0 and 2), and "rats" and "arts" are similar, but "star" is not similar to "tars", "rats", or "arts".  

Together, these form two connected groups by similarity: {"tars", "rats", "arts"} and {"star"}.  Notice that "tars" and "arts" are in the same group even though they are not similar.  Formally, each group is such that a word is in the group if and only if it is similar to at least one other word in the group.  

We are given a list A of unique strings.  Every string in A is an anagram of every other string in A.  How many groups are there?  

Example 1:  

    Input: ["tars","rats","arts","star"]
    Output: 2

Note:  

1.  A.length <= 2000
2.  A[i].length <= 1000
3.  A.length \* A[i].length <= 20000
4.  All words in A consist of lowercase letters only.
5.  All words in A have the same length and are anagrams of each other.
6.  The judging time limit has been increased for this question.
