Permutation in String  

---

Given two strings s1 and s2, write a function to return true if s2 contains the permutation of s1. In other words, one of the first string's permutations is the substring of the second string.  

    Example 1:
    Input:s1 = "ab" s2 = "eidbaooo"
    Output:True
    Explanation: s2 contains one permutation of s1 ("ba").

    Example 2:
    Input:s1= "ab" s2 = "eidboaoo"
    Output: False

Note:  
1.  The input strings only contain lower case letters.
2.  The length of both given strings is in range [1, 10,000].

    ## Basic Ideas: Sliding window in s2 with length of s1
    ##              It has only lowercase, use ch[26] to speed up the comparision.
    ##
    ## Complexity: Time O(n), Space O(1)
