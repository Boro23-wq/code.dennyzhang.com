Design a Phone Directory which supports the following operations:  

1.  get: Provide a number which is not assigned to anyone.
2.  check: Check if a number is available or not.
3.  release: Recycle or release a number.

Example:  

    // Init a phone directory containing a total of 3 numbers: 0, 1, and 2.
    PhoneDirectory directory = new PhoneDirectory(3);
    
    // It can return any available phone number. Here we assume it returns 0.
    directory.get();
    
    // Assume it returns 1.
    directory.get();
    
    // The number 2 is available, so return true.
    directory.check(2);
    
    // It returns 2, the only number that is left.
    directory.get();
    
    // The number 2 is no longer available, so return false.
    directory.check(2);
    
    // Release number 2 back to the pool.
    directory.release(2);
    
    // Number 2 is available again, return true.
    directory.check(2);

    ## Basic Ideas: One collection: free_set
    ##
    ##  Notcie: here we only need one collection(free_set), instead of two (occupied_set and free_set)
    ## Complexity: Time O(1), Space O(n)
