Given a pattern and a string str, find if str follows the same pattern.  

Here follow means a full match, such that there is a bijection between a letter in pattern and a non-empty substring in str.  

Examples:  

1.  pattern = "abab", str = "redblueredblue" should return true.
2.  pattern = "aaaa", str = "asdasdasdasd" should return true.
3.  pattern = "aabb", str = "xyzabcxzyabc" should return false.

Notes:  
You may assume both pattern and str contains only lowercase letters.

    ## Basic Ideas:
    ##  In str, not all words are the same length
    ##
    ## Complexity:
    class Solution(object):
        def wordPatternMatch(self, pattern, str):
    	"""
    	:type pattern: str
    	:type str: str
    	:rtype: bool
    	"""
    	len1, len2 = len(pattern), len(str)
    	if len1 == 0 or len2 == 0: return len1 == len2
    	# problematic?
    	if len2%len1 != 0: return False
    	word_len = len2/len1
    	d, seen = {}, set([])
    	for i in range(len1):
    	    ch = pattern[i]
    	    word = str[i*word_len:(i+1)*word_len]
    	    if ch in d:
    		if d[ch] != word: return False
    	    else:
    		if word in seen: return False
    		d[ch] = word
    		seen.add(word)
    	return True
