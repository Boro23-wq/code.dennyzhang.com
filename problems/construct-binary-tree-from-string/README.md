You need to construct a binary tree from a string consisting of parenthesis and integers.  

The whole input represents a binary tree. It contains an integer followed by zero, one or two pairs of parenthesis. The integer represents the root's value and a pair of parenthesis contains a child binary tree with the same structure.  

You always start to construct the left child node of the parent first if it exists.  

Example:  

    Input: "4(2(3)(1))(6(5))"
    Output: return the tree root node representing the following tree:
    
           4
         /   \
        2     6
       / \   / 
      3   1 5   

Note:  

1.  There will only be '(', ')', '-' and '0' ~ '9' in the input string.
2.  An empty tree is represented by "" instead of "()".
