For a undirected graph with tree characteristics, we can choose any node as the root. The result graph is then a rooted tree. Among all possible rooted trees, those with minimum height are called minimum height trees (MHTs). Given such a graph, write a function to find all the MHTs and return a list of their root labels.  

Format  
The graph contains n nodes which are labeled from 0 to n - 1. You will be given the number n and a list of undirected edges (each edge is a pair of labels).  

You can assume that no duplicate edges will appear in edges. Since all edges are undirected, [0, 1] is the same as [1, 0] and thus will not appear together in edges.  

Example 1:  

    Given n = 4, edges = [[1, 0], [1, 2], [1, 3]]
    
            0
            |
            1
           / \
          2   3
    return [1]

Example 2:  

    Given n = 6, edges = [[0, 3], [1, 3], [2, 3], [4, 3], [5, 4]]
    
         0  1  2
          \ | /
            3
            |
            4
            |
            5
    return [3, 4]

Note:  

1.  According to the definition of tree on Wikipedia: "a tree is an undirected graph in which any two vertices are connected by exactly one path. In other words, any connected graph without simple cycles is a tree."
2.  The height of a rooted tree is the number of edges on the longest downward path between the root and a leaf.
