We are given two strings, A and B.  

A shift on A consists of taking string A and moving the leftmost character to the rightmost position. For example, if A = 'abcde', then it will be 'bcdea' after one shift on A. Return True if and only if A can become B after some number of shifts on A.  

Example 1:  

    Input: A = 'abcde', B = 'cdeab'
    Output: true

Example 2:  

    Input: A = 'abcde', B = 'abced'
    Output: false

Note:  

-   A and B will have length at most 100.
