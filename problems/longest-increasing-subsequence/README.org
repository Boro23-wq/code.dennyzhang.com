---------------------------------------------------------------------
Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest increasing subsequence.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
For example,
Given [10, 9, 2, 5, 3, 7, 101, 18],
The longest increasing subsequence is [2, 3, 7, 101], therefore the length is 4. Note that there may be more than one LIS combination, it is only necessary for you to return the length.
#+END_EXAMPLE

Follow up: Could you improve it to O(n log n) time complexity?
