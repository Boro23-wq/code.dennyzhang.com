Find Smallest Letter Greater Than Target  

---

Given a list of sorted characters letters containing only lowercase letters, and given a target letter target, find the smallest element in the list that is larger than the given target.  

Letters also wrap around. For example, if the target is target = 'z' and letters = ['a', 'b'], the answer is 'a'.  

Examples:  

    Input:
    letters = ["c", "f", "j"]
    target = "a"
    Output: "c"

    Input:
    letters = ["c", "f", "j"]
    target = "c"
    Output: "f"

    Input:
    letters = ["c", "f", "j"]
    target = "d"
    Output: "f"

    Input:
    letters = ["c", "f", "j"]
    target = "g"
    Output: "j"

    Input:
    letters = ["c", "f", "j"]
    target = "j"
    Output: "c"

    Input:
    letters = ["c", "f", "j"]
    target = "k"
    Output: "c"

Note:  

1.  letters has a length in range [2, 10000].
2.  letters consists of lowercase letters, and contains at least 2 unique letters.
3.  target is a lowercase letter.
