This is a follow up of [[https://code.dennyzhang.com/shortest-word-distance][Shortest Word Distance]]. The only difference is now you are given the list of words and your method will be called repeatedly many times with different parameters. How would you optimize it?

Design a class which receives a list of words in the constructor, and implements a method that takes two words word1 and word2 and return the shortest distance between these two words in the list.

For example,
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Assume that words = ["practice", "makes", "perfect", "coding", "makes"].

Given word1 = "coding", word2 = "practice", return 3.
Given word1 = "makes", word2 = "coding", return 1.
#+END_EXAMPLE

Note:
You may assume that word1 does not equal to word2, and word1 and word2 are both in the list.

- Solution: hashmap

// Blog link: https://code.dennyzhang.com/shortest-word-distance-ii
