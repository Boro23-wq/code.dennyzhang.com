Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.  

    (i.e., 0 1 2 4 5 6 7 might become 4 5 6 7 0 1 2).

Find the minimum element.  

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

    class Solution:
        ## Basic Ideas: Binary Search
        ##   Check current node with the right node of the range
        ##   If it's smaller, check left half(included). Check the right half(excluded)
        ##
        ##   Notice: Here we can't compare it with the left node of the range.
        ##      Why? (0+1)/2 == 0. We might run into dead loop with left == mid.
        ##
        ## Complexity: Time O(log(n)), Space O(1)

        ## Basic Ideas: Binary Search
        ##     Find the first element, who is smaller than the first element
        ##     If not found, the first element is the target
