First Unique Character in a String  

---

Given a string, find the first non-repeating character in it and return it's index. If it doesn't exist, return -1.  

    Examples:
    
    s = "leetcode"
    return 0.
    
    s = "loveleetcode",
    return 2.
    Note: You may assume the string contain only lowercase letters.
