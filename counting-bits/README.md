Given a non negative integer number num. For every numbers i in the range 0 <= i <= num calculate the number of 1's in their binary representation and return them as an array.  

Example:  
For num = 5 you should return [0,1,1,2,1,2].  

Follow up:  

-   It is very easy to come up with a solution with run time O(n\*sizeof(integer)). But can you do it in linear time O(n) /possibly in a single pass?
-   Space complexity should be O(n).
-   Can you do it like a boss? Do it without using any builtin function like \_\_builtin\_popcount in c++ or in any other language.

    ## Basic Ideas:
    ##      If k%2 == 0, f(k) = f(k/2)
    ##      If k%2 == 1, f(k) = f(k-1)
    ##
    ## Complexity: Time O(n), Space O(n)
